# McDonald's Nutritional Analysis üçîü•ó

This project analyzes the nutritional information of menu items from McDonald's. Conducted as part of a data analytics internship at Oasis Infobyte, the analysis provides insights into the nutritional profile of McDonald's offerings through data exploration, visualization, and correlation analysis.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze McDonald's menu data to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns within various nutritional metrics. Key analysis areas include macronutrient distribution, correlations between calorie content and fat, and insights into vitamins and minerals.

## Key Insights and Findings

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Menu Category Distribution
- Visualized the number of menu items across food categories to understand McDonald's diversity in offerings.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Nutritional Correlation
- Explored the relationship between **calories** and **calories from fat**, calculating a correlation coefficient to quantify their association.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Saturated Fat Analysis
- Identified the top 5 food categories with the highest percentage of saturated fat, providing insights for potential nutritional awareness.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Nutritional Composition by Category
- Analyzed the mean percentage of saturated fat across categories like Coffee & Tea, Smoothies & Shakes, Salads, and Chicken & Fish.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Vitamins & Minerals
- Assessed the mean daily values of **Vitamin A**, **Vitamin C**, **Iron**, and **Calcium** in different menu categories to evaluate nutritional content.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Total Fat vs. Total Carbohydrate
- Investigated the balance between **total fat** and **total carbohydrate** percentages to understand macronutrient distribution across menu items.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Iron and Calcium Distribution
- Visualized the distribution of **iron** and **calcium** levels across menu categories to highlight McDonald's nutritional diversity.
